Enhance your Salesforce productivity with powerful hotkeys and customizable quick links! This extension streamlines navigation and task management, making your workflow faster and more efficient.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üöÄ Direct Options Page Access:** Clicking the extension icon now opens the **Options Page** directly in a new tab for easy configuration.

* **üîó Customizable Quick Links:** Create personalized shortcuts to specific Salesforce pages:
    * **Simplified Link Input:** Enter the Salesforce URL path *after* your domain (e.g., `/lightning/o/Account/list`).
    * **Unique Key:** Assign a memorable key to your link. This key, when combined with `Alt + Shift`, will be your custom shortcut (e.g., if you enter `L`, the shortcut will be `Alt + Shift + L`).
    * **Descriptive Name:** Give your shortcut a friendly name for quick recognition.
    * The extension intelligently adds your current Salesforce domain to these links for instant access. Manage your quick links on the **Options Page**.

* **‚å®Ô∏è Powerful Hotkeys:** Speed up common Salesforce actions with these keyboard shortcuts:
    * `Alt + N`: **Create New Record** for any standard or custom object.
    * `Alt + A`: **Toggle App Launcher** open or closed from anywhere in Salesforce.
    * **Custom Quick Link Hotkeys:** Access your customized quick links using the shortcut `Alt + Shift + [Your Assigned Key]`. For example, if you assigned the key `C` to your "Contacts" list view, the shortcut would be `Alt + Shift + C`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

1.  **Installation:**
    * Download the extension files.
    * Open Chrome's Extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`.
    * Enable **"Developer mode"** (top right).
        * Click **"Load unpacked"** (top left) and select the extension's folder.

2.  **Accessing Options:** Click the **Salesforce Accelerator** extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. The **Options Page** will open in a new tab.

3.  **Managing Quick Links (on the Options Page):**
    * **Adding a New Link:**
        * In the "Key" field, type a unique single character key for this shortcut (e.g., `C`, `Q`, `1`).
        * In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name.
        * In the "Link" field, enter the Salesforce URL path *without* your domain.
        * Click the **Add** button.
    * **Removing a Link:** Find your saved shortcuts in the list and click the **"Remove"** button next to the one you want to delete.

4.  **Using Hotkeys:** Once installed, the default hotkeys (`Alt + N` and `Alt + A`) are active on any Salesforce page. Your custom quick links can be accessed using `Alt + Shift + [Your Assigned Key]`.
