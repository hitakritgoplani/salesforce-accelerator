## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üöÄ Direct Options Page Access:** Clicking the extension icon now opens the **Options Page** directly in a new tab for easy configuration.

* **üîó Customizable Quick Links:** Create personalized shortcuts to specific Salesforce pages:
    * **Unique Key:** Assign a memorable **single letter (a-z)** to your link. This key, when combined with `Alt + Shift`, will be your custom shortcut (e.g., if you enter `l`, the shortcut will be `Alt + Shift + l`).
    * **Feature selection** Select the salesforce feature from the dropdown (like **Setup**, **Flows**, etc.).
    * Click **Add**.
    * The extension intelligently adds your current Salesforce domain to these links for instant access. Manage your quick links on the **Options Page**.

* **‚å®Ô∏è Powerful Hotkeys:** Speed up common Salesforce actions with these keyboard shortcuts:
    * `Alt + N`: **Create New Record** for any standard or custom object.
    * `Alt + A`: **Toggle App Launcher** open or closed from anywhere in Salesforce.
    * **Custom Quick Link Hotkeys:** Access your customized quick links using the shortcut `Alt + Shift + [Your Assigned Key]`. For example, if you assigned the key `c` to your "Contacts" list view, the shortcut would be `Alt + Shift + c`.

        * Select the salesforce feature from the dropdown (like **Setup**, **Flows**, etc.).
        * Click the **Add** button.
    * **Removing a Link:** Find your saved shortcuts in the list and click the **"Remove"** button next to the one you want to delete.
